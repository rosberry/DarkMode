DarkMode is a small framework that simplify configuration of light and dark user interface styles and reduce checks of available SDKs.

## Requirements

- iOS 12.0+ / tvOS 12.0+
- Xcode 10.0+

## Usage

DarkMode contains 4 extensions of UIKit components.

1. UIColor extension contains an initializer with light and dark colors:

   ```swift
   static let layer = UIColor(light: .init(red: 106 / 255, green: 32 / 255, blue: 119 / 255, alpha: 1),
                              dark: .init(red: 138 / 255, green: 76 / 255, blue: 146 / 255, alpha: 1))
   ```

2. UIImageAsset extension contains an initializer with light and dark images:

   ```swift
   let imageAsset = UIImageAsset(lightModeImage: UIImage(named: "RedRectangle"),
                                 darkModeImage: UIImage(named: "GreenRectangle"))
   ```

3. UITraitCollection extension has optional check of different color appearance:

   ```swift
   override func traitCollectionDidChange(_ previousTraitCollection: UITraitCollection?) {
       super.traitCollectionDidChange(previousTraitCollection)
       traitCollection.performForDifferentColorAppearance(comparedTo: previousTraitCollection) {
           //update related colors
       }
   }
   ```

4. UIWindow extension allows you to override user interface style without SDK checks:

   ```swift
   UIApplication.shared.keyWindow?.override(.dark)
   ```
